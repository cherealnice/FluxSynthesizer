# Flux Synthesizer
[Live Demo](www.test.com)

A web-based keyboard implementing ReactJS which allows creating and loading tracks from a database and real-time computer-keyboard playing.

### Features
This synthesizer allows you to play in real-time, and also record and save tracks for later playback.  The keyboard is only active when CAPS lock is engaged, allowing the user to navitage while the app is open.

### React Components
* Organ
* Key
* Recorder
* Jukebox
* Track Player

These components follow Flux Application Architecture to render in real-time, and communicate with the database using AJAX requests for creating and loading tracks.

### How to Run

* Download this repository
* Install Rails and/or PostgreSQL (if necessary)
* Bundle install
* Create database/Run migrations
* Start Rails Server
* Open in browser
* Jam out on some funky tunes!
